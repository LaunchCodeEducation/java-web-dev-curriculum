# Java Web Development

## Course Summary

This course is an introduction to **Java** and the Spring Boot framework. Java is a
powerful programming language and one of the most widely used across the globe. 
This course is designed for learners who are already familiar with at least one
programming language. Thus, we'll move quickly through the syntax rules and
procedural basics of the language (ie, how does one write a for loop in Java? a 
conditional statement?). 

As you've likely heard before, once you grasp the fundamentals of programming in 
one language, learning another becomes much easier. Professional software 
developers often work in environments involving several programming languages so 
it's wise to start learning new ones early on in your career. 

Beyond the basics of programming in Java, you'll learn some key *object oriented*
concepts to enhance the capabilities of your programs. You'll also download a 
program called **IntelliJ IDE** to get familiar with the tools of the Java developer.
In the final lessons of this course, you will use a Java framework called **Spring Boot**.
This framework gives us the scaffolding necessary to create *MVC* programs, another
concept we'll cover, effectively and efficiently.

## Where this Course Leads

Upon completion of the content within this course you will be capable of building a web application with Spring MVC that can store data in a local database. You will also be ready to start reviewing the Liftoff materials, which focus on career-readiness and building a personal project.

While you are entering a new career in technology, we hope you use the tools you learned in this program to learn new skills. You may find yourself wanting to learn more about the cloud, advanced testing tools, or building bigger and better APIs. Whatever it is, now that you have conquered the foundations of computer programming, we know you are ready for the challenge!

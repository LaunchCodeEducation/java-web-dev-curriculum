IntelliJ is an **integrated development environment (IDE)**. An IDE is like a text
editor on steroids. It not only allows you to write and edit code, but also contains many 
features that enhance the coding experience. IntelliJ offers
code completion hints, debugging, and even it's own compiler. We'll be using it throughout
this course, so it's time to get familiar with some of the basics.

## Install IntelliJ

Visit the [IntelliJ download site](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
Select your operating system and the Community version. Follow the installation
prompts to select your settings.

Make sure before downloading that you are downloading the Community version. You may have to scroll down through the page to find the Community version. The main version of IntelliJ is a paid version and may have different features than the Community version.

When you reach the window asking for *Installation Options*, select the
*Add "bin" folder to the PATH* box. Click *Next*. If
you are asked for any other input, accept the default options.

You will finish on an IntelliJ welcome panel listing options to create a
*New Project*, *Open* a project, or *Get from VCS* (a.k.a Version Control
System).

This means you've installed IntelliJ, and you're ready to start exploring its many features.

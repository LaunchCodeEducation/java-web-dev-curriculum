## Run the Tests
At this point, all autograding tests should be passing. To be sure, right-click on the `org.launchcode.techjobs.oo` package in `src/test/java` and select _Run tests inâ€¦_ 

### If ANY fail:
Evaluate the failure/error message and go back to fix your code.

### If ALL pass:
Excellent work! You successfully shifted the old console app into a more useful object oriented configuration.

Now that the new structure is ready, another team member can refactor the import and display methods to use the new classes. Once these are ready, our team will refine the search features and move the app online to provide a better user interface.

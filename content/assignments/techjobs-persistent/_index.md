## Your Task

You will once again work with the `Tech Jobs` application. This time around you'll add ORM
functionality by using Spring Data. You will be responsible for completing the code to allow users
to create new job data.

<!-- TODO: Link will need to be updated once entered into the book -->
Your final application will have the same list and search capabilities as your [Tech Jobs (MVC Edition)]() but
you'll need to do the work to connect the project to a database for storing user-submitted job data. 

Each of the four sections of this assignment will also ask you to demonstrate your SQL skills under an item labelled **SQL TASK**.

As you work through each part, refer to our [demo app](https://techjobs-persistent.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/) to clarify questions about intended application behavior.

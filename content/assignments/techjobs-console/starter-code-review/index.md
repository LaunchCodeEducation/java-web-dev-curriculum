Before diving in and starting to code, make sure you understand what the code you've been given does. Since you're starting with a functioning---albeit unfinished---program, go ahead and run it to get an idea of how it works.

The application will run until you force it to quit, re-prompting time
after time. To kill it, press the "stop" icon in the upper corner the of Run pane. We'll learn precisely how the program manages to work this way below.

{{% /notice %}}

Let's explore the code by starting with the source of the data our program is
providing access to.


### The Data File: `jobs_data.csv`

Our simple app doesn't connect to a database. If the prototype proves useful and we continue development, we'll add that functionality later.
But for now, we've been given a CSV (comma-separated values) file from the Company Team at LaunchCode that contains some recent jobs. This file was exported from an Excel spreadsheet into this format, which is easy for programs to read in.

If CSV files are new to you, don't worry, they're easy to understand. CSV files are conceptually similar to simple spreadsheets in that they organize data in rows and columns. The major difference is that they don't have the ability to carry out calculations the way spreadsheets
do, and you can easily open, read, and edit them in plain text editors.

Open up `jobs_data.csv`, which is in the `src/main/java/resources` folder. You'll see that the first line is:

```bash
name,employer,location,position type,core competency
```

While it isn't required, the first line of a CSV file often represents the column names. We have 5 names here, which indicates that each of our rows in the CSV file should have 5 fields. In this file format, a "row" corresponds to a new line. So each line below the first will constitute a row of data, or a record.

Have a look at the data below line 1, and ask yourself the following
questions:

1. Which fields match up with which column names above?
2. Why do some lines/rows (e.g.Â line 10) have more commas than others, if
   commas are supposed to separate columns?
3. What role do the double-quotes play?

### The TechJobs Class

The ``TechJobs`` class contains the ``main`` method that will drive our
program's functionality. It contains three methods:

1. ``main`` - The main application runner.
2. ``getUserSelection`` - A utility method that displays a menu of choices and
   returns the user's selection.
3. ``printJobs`` - This is meant to print a list of jobs to the console in a
   nicely formatted manner, but hasn't been implemented yet. This will be part
   of your job.

Let's look at each of these.

## The `main` Method

The logic within `main` presents menus in turn, and based on the user's choice, takes appropriate action.

It begins by declaring two local variables: `columnChoices` and `actionChoices`. These contain information relating to the menus that we'll display, and we'll look at them in more detail later.

Next, we notice a `while loop` that starts `while (true)`. While we usually want to avoid creating infinite loops, we have a good reason for doing so in this case! We want our application to continually run until the user decides they want to quit. The simplest way to do this is to loop forever. When the user wants to quit, they can enter `x` at the initial "View jobs by" prompt. As you saw above, however, IntelliJ's *Run* pane works slightly differently and you'll need to rely on the red "stop" icon to stop the program.

{{% notice blue Note "rocket" %}}
Another way to kill a running program from the terminal is by pressing ctrl-C (a widely-known command to kill a console application). This will work in any terminal context, and not just for our console program in IntelliJ
{{% /notice %}}

The `main` method can be summarized as follows:

1. Present the user with choices on how to view data: *list* or *search*.
2. Based on that choice, prompt them for the column to apply the choice to. In the case of a search, we also ask for a search term.
3. Carry out the request to the `JobData` class via one of its public methods.
4. Display the results of the request.
5. Repeat.

`main` simulates a query to an external source:

1. We ask the method for data that originates from a non-Java source.
2. The method parses and filters that data.
3. The method presents the data in a useful manner.

## The `getUserSelection` Method

The `getUserSelection` method takes in a String to display above the menu, to provide context for what they are being asked. It also takes in a `HashMap` with String keys and String values. How is this used? What will this `HashMap` contain when the method runs?

To figure this out, right-click on the method name and select *Find Usages*. This will open a pane and display each location in the program where `getUserSelection` is called. The first such usage is the first line of the main `while loop`:

```java
String actionChoice = getUserSelection("View jobs by:", actionChoices);
```

What is this `HashMap` named `actionChoices`? If we look a few lines above, we see:

```java
// Top-level menu options
HashMap<String, String> actionChoices = new HashMap<>();
actionChoices.put("search", "Search");
actionChoices.put("list", "List");
```

If you recall how the program worked when you ran it, the first menu that you chose had two options, *Search* and *List*, which seem to correspond to the entries in `actionChoices`. This is, in fact, the case. This is the data that is used to generate the first menu we see when running the program.

## The second usage of `getUserSelection` is a few lines below:

```java
String columnChoice = getUserSelection("List", columnChoices);
```

This references `columnChoices`, which is declared at the top of `main` and has a similar structure to `actionChoices` (they're the same data type and are used in calls to the same method, so this shouldn't be surprising). Most of the entries in `columnChoices` correspond to columns in the jobs data set, but there's one additional entry with key/value pair `"all"`/`"All"`. These entries will help us present to the user the options for searching our data, which will correspond to searching within a given column, or searching all columns at once.

The keys in `actionChoices` and `columnChoices` represent the "internal" String we'll use to refer to these options (e.g. when representing the user's menu choice or querying data). The values in the map represent the "external" way that these are represented to the user.

Within `getUserSelection` itself, most of the code is within a `do-while loop`. A [do-while loop](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/while.html) is similar to a `while` loop, but the conditional check is at the end of the loop's code block. This has the net consequence that the loop's code block always runs at least once. At the end of the block's execution, we check a condition to determine if we should run the block again. This nicely mimics the behavior of simple menu-driven applications.

Within this loop, menu options are printed to the screen, and user input is collected. If the input is valid, it returns the choice as a `String` to the caller. This `String` corresponds to the chosen key (from `choices`, which will be either `actionChoices` or `columnChoices`) of the item the user selected. If invalid, it re-prompts the user.

The local variable `choiceKeys` is used to easily enumerate the `choices` `HashMap`. In other words, it gives us a simple way to provide an ordering to `choices`, which doesn't have an ordering of its own.

## The JobData Class

The `JobData` class is responsible for importing the data from the CSV file and parsing it into a Java-friendly format, that is, into `HashMap` and `ArrayList` form. Look toward the bottom of the class, and you will see a method named `loadData`, which does just what it advertises. After parsing the file data, it stores the data in the private property `allJobs`, which is of type `ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>`.

{{% notice blue Note "rocket" %}}
We haven't covered static properties and methods in-depth yet. For this assignment, know simply that they allow us to use properties and methods of a class without creating an object from that class. For example, we can call `JobData.findAll()` from the `TechJob` class.

If you want to create a new method in `JobData` or add a property, be sure to declare it as `static`.
{{% /notice %}}

Let's look more closely at the data type of `allJobs`. It purports to be an `ArrayList` that stores `HashMap` objects, which have `String` keys and `String` values. If we were to represent some of this data visually, using `[]` for an `ArrayList` and `{}` with key/value pairs, it would look like this:

```java
[
    {
        "name": "Junior Data Analyst",
        "employer": "Lockerdome",
        "location": "Saint Louis",
        "position type": "Data Scientist / Business Intelligence",
        "core competency": "Statistical Analysis"
    },
    {
        "name": "Junior Web Developer",
        "employer": "Cozy",
        "location": "Portland",
        "position type": "Web - Back End",
        "core competency": "Ruby"
    },
    ...
]
```

If you look at the `loadData` method, you'll see a lot of unfamiliar code. Blake wrote this essential piece of code for you, and while you won't have to modify it, it will be useful to have an idea of how it works. Read through the code until you feel like you can describe its functionality at a basic level.

There are three more methods in `JobData`, each of which is public (and `static`, per our earlier note): `findAll()`, `findAll(String)`, and `findByColumnAndValue(String, String)`. Note that there are two methods named `findAll`, but this is allowed in Java via a feature called **overloading**. Overloading happens when multiple methods have the same name, but they each have different input parameters (also called argument lists). Read more about [overloading](http://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/method-overloading/).

Here are some questions to ask yourself while reading this code:

1. What is the data type of a "job" record?
2. Why does `findAll(String)` return something of type `ArrayList<String>` while `findByColumnAndValue(String, String)` and `findAll()` return something of type `ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>`?
3. Why is `loadData()` called at the top of each of these four methods? Does this mean that we load the data from the CSV file each time one of them is called?

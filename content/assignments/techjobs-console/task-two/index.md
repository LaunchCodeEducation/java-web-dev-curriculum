## Complete the `FindByValue()` Method

At this stage, the application will allow users to search a *given
column* of the data for a given string. Your next task is to enable a
search that looks for the search term in *all* of the columns.

In the `JobData` class, find the method `FindByValue()`. This method has been outlined
for you but contains none of the code needed to work (leave the `LoadData()` call as the first line of the method). Here are a few observations:

1. The code that you write should not return duplicate jobs. For example, if a listing has position type "Web - Front End" and name "Front end web dev" then searching for "web" should not include the listing twice.
1. As with `PrintJobs()`, write your code in a way that if a new column is added to the data, your code will automatically search the new column as well.
1. Do NOT write code that calls `FindByColumnAndValue()` once for each column. Rather, utilize loops and collection methods.
1. Reading and understanding `FindByColumnAndValue()`, will help as your code will look similar in some ways.

You'll need to call `FindByValue()` from somewhere in `RunProgram()`. We'll
leave it up to you to find where. You might have noticed that when you
try to search all columns using the app, a message is printed, so that
is a good clue to help you find where to place this new method call.
Once you find where to call your new method, you can *Run* the program
again to test your code.

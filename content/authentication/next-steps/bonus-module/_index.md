This section contains 5 lessons to build out the **authentication**
and **authorization** features in Coding Events. The video shows the
final features added as a result of the lessons. You will add user-owned
data, refactored controllers to make use of services, refactored
authentication and authorization using Spring Security framework,
and roles & privileges to restrict access to the Coding Events based
on assigned user roles.

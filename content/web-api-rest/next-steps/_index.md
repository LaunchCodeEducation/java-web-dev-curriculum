We have covered the fundamental aspects of the RESTful mental model and practical usage. However, RESTful design is a deep topic that even extends beyond the web and use of HTTP!

If you want to learn more, the following links are a good start:

#### Practical Understanding

- [Craig Dennis: APIs for beginners (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us&t=0s)
- [REST sub-collections, relationships and links](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/relationships.html)
- [OpenAPI specification and Swagger REST tools](https://swagger.io/specification/)
- [The GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and [Stripe (payment processing) API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) are excellent examples of RESTful design (and fantastic documentation)

#### Deep Understanding

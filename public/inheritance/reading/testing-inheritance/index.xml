    <link>http://localhost:1313/inheritance/reading/testing-inheritance/index.html</link>
    <description>Not sure you get the whole inheritance idea? Still not sure which fields and methods get inherited and which are overridden? Looking to test your understanding? (wink)&#xA;Knowing what we know now about unit-testing and inheritance , we can test that our subclasses extend their base classes.&#xA;We can add a test folder to our inheritance package and write some code to ensure that HouseCat inherits what we expect it to.</description>

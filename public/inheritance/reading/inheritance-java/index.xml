    <title>Inheritance in Java :: Java Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/inheritance/reading/inheritance-java/index.html</link>
    <description>Letâ€™s examine an inheritance relationship between two classes, Cat and HouseCat. HouseCat is a class that inherits from Cat. When defined, HouseCat thus receives the data and behaviors of Cat. These inherited traits are things like fields, properties, and methods. Any fields and non-constructor methods in Cat are available to each instance of HouseCat.&#xA;When we speak about an inheritance relationship, we say that a HouseCat is a Cat, or extends Cat.</description>

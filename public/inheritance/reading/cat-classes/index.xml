    <link>http://localhost:1313/inheritance/reading/cat-classes/index.html</link>
    <description>Letâ€™s revisit our Cat and HouseCat friends. In java-web-dev-projects, open inheritance/testing-inheritance/tale-of-two-cats/src/main/java and examine the two classes inside.&#xA;Inheriting Fields and Properties Notice that Cat has a private string field family, representing the biological family of all cats.&#xA;private String family = &#34;Felidae&#34;;This field is not directly accessible by HouseCat since it is private. However, it may be read via the public getter getFamily.&#xA;public String getFamily() { return family; }There is no setter for family, however.</description>

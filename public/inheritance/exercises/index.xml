    <link>http://localhost:1313/inheritance/exercises/index.html</link>
    <description>Work on these exercises within IntelliJ using the java-web-dev-projects project you already created. Add a new package called technology to your exercises directory.&#xA;Class design: Create a new class called Computer. Before you add any more code, know that you will need to add two additional classes: Laptop and SmartPhone. Before you start coding anything inside these classes, diagram how the three classes are going to be related to each other.</description>

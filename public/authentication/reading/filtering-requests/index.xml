    <title>Filtering Requests :: Java Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/authentication/reading/filtering-requests/index.html</link>
    <description>Our application now allows users to register and log in. However, access to pages on the site is NOT yet restricted in any way. Even if a user isn’t logged in, they may view any page on the site. To fully implement authentication, we need to be able to check a user’s login status on each request, before any controller methods are called.&#xA;We can do this by filtering requests. Request filtering is a mechanism available in many web frameworks.</description>

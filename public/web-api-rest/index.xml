      <description>We’ve created a basic API application here . Before we ask you to fork and clone this, let’s first think conceptually about the kinds of requests a client application could make to this API.&#xA;The API The api starts by only exposing a single resource, Event, and four endpoints for interacting with it.&#xA;The Resource The shape of the Event resource describes the general form of its properties and value types:</description>

      <description>The UI of a browser is designed to make simple GET requests for URLs entered into its address bar. This design works great for browsing sites, but falls short when working with APIs. Anything beyond a GET request is difficult to send via a browser address bar alone. Think about what is needed to create a new Event. This type of request contains a body. Our MVC application included a view to allow us to test inputs.</description>

      <description>We have covered the fundamentals aspects of the RESTful mental model and practical usage. However, RESTful design is a deep topic that even extends beyond the web and use of HTTP!&#xA;If you want to learn more, the following links are a good start:&#xA;Practical Understanding Craig Dennis: APIs for beginners (YouTube) REST sub-collections, relationships and links OpenAPI specification and Swagger REST tools The GitHub API and Stripe (payment processing) API are excellent examples of RESTful design (and fantastic documentation) Deep Understanding the REST constraints The Richardson REST maturity model the original REST doctoral thesis by Roy Fielding </description>

    <title>Models Binding :: Java Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/models-and-model-binding/reading/model-binding/index.html</link>
    <description>We now introduce a useful technique to auto-create model instances, called model binding. Model binding takes place when a whole model object is created by the Spring framework on form submission. This saves us the effort, and the code, needed to pass in each form field to a controller.&#xA;Model binding reduces the amount of code we need to write to create an object and it helps with validation (which weâ€™ll explore further in the next section).</description>

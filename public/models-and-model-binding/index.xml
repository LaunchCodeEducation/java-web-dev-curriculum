      <description>Add functionality to edit event objects in your codingevents application. These exercises assume that you have added all of the code from this section of the book and your application resembles the model-binding branch of CodingEventsJava .&#xA;Create a new branch from here with a descriptive name, such as edit-events. The edit form will resemble the form used to create an event.&#xA;Tip As you work through these steps, test your code along the way!</description>

      <description>For this studio, you will add functionality to allow users to sign up for your spa-day app.&#xA;The starter code has been modified from where you left off last class. Grab the refactored code on the user-signup-starter branch .&#xA;You’ll notice in this branch that the name field has been removed from the service selection form. Once we implement user-signup functionality, we can use a given user’s name to identify the spa client.</description>

      <description>Work on these exercises in the java-web-dev-projects repo,creating a new class for each item. You may call these classes whatever you like, but remember to use the proper Java naming conventions.&#xA;Navigate inside control-flow-and-collections within java-web-dev-projects and create a new folder called exercises. Create a new IntelliJ project within your new exercises directory called collections-exercises. Now you are ready to start creating new classes and practice using different collections!</description>

      <description>In this studio, you will write a program to count the number of times each character occurs in a string and then print the results to the console.&#xA;Feel free to prompt the user for a string. However, for the sake of simplicity, you might want to start by hard-coding some text and storing it in a variable. For your convenience, here is a quote from the movie Hidden Figures:</description>

    <title>Task 4: Display Search Results :: Java Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/techjobs-mvc/display-search-results/index.html</link>
    <description>Once you have your displaySearchResults handler passing information to the view, you need to display the data.&#xA;In search.html, create a loop to display each job passed in from the controller. Put the job results into a set of tables, similar to what you did for the list-jobs view. Tip You can reuse the code you just wrote in list-jobs.html by defining a new fragment in that file. Then you need to include that fragment in search.</description>

      <description>Assignment #2: Tech Jobs (Object-Oriented Edition) Introduction Your apprenticeship at LaunchCode is going well! Only a few weeks in and you’re regularly making contributions to code that will eventually be used by all LaunchCode staff.&#xA;Your last task was to get the prototype Tech Jobs app in good shape. Now it’s time to advance the underlying structure of the program.&#xA;Your mentor on this project is Sally, one of the developers at LaunchCode.</description>

      <description>Introduction Your first two tasks as an apprentice went well! You, Blake, and Sally built the TechJobs console prototype and then refactored the code to move it to an object-oriented format.&#xA;After demonstrating the prototype for the Company Team at LaunchCode, it received the green light to be fully built out as a web application.&#xA;The first step in this process will be to quickly develop a minimum viable product , or MVP.</description>

      <description>Your Task You will once again work with the Tech Jobs application. This time around you’ll add ORM functionality by using Spring Data. You will be responsible for completing the code to allow users to create new job data.&#xA;Your final application will have the same list and search capabilities as your Tech Jobs (MVC Edition) but you’ll need to do the work to connect the project to a database for storing user-submitted job data.</description>

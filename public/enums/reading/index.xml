Enum types are special classes that should have only one of a set of fixed values, such as days of the week.&#xA;Imagine that we wanted to add a field to Event to specify which day of the week an event takes place.

      <description>One application of enum types is to represent categories of objects. We will take this approach in our coding-events application to categorize events based on their type, such as conference or meetup.&#xA;Enum Types in Models - Video Note The starter code for this video is found at the display-errors branch of the CodingEventsJava repo. The final code presented in this video is found on the enums branch . As always, code along to the videos on your own codingevents project.</description>

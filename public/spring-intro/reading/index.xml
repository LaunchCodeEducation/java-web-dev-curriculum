      <description>So far, we have been designing our applications by diagramming classes, drawing connections, and abstracting via interfaces. This practice benefits us because we can start seeing issues before we start coding. Many software developers start their applications with this process. Before we start diagramming our Cat class and our HouseCat class, we decide on the template for our design that we want to use. These design templates that are abstract solutions to common software architecture problems are called design patterns.</description>

      <description>Spring Boot is a framework used to build Java web applications that implement the MVC pattern. For more about Spring, check out Spring IO .&#xA;As you code along with the videos, you will be working on your own project. Should you want to review a step or double-check your code, fork LaunchCodeâ€™s hello-spring-demo repository to see what the code looked like at each stage. The repository is up on Github .</description>

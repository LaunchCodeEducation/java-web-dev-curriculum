    <title>Exercises :: Java Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/controllers-and-routing/exercises/index.html</link>
    <description>While reading the chapter, you created a basic Hello, World application using Spring Boot called hello-spring. Open that project up in IntelliJ, and get ready to add some features!&#xA;Note Before you start these exercises, take a look at the hello-spring class-annotations branch to make sure your own application matches ours.&#xA;Create and checkout a branch for your exercises solution. Name it something useful, such as controller-exercises.&#xA;Modify your HelloController class to display a form on a GET request that asks the user for both their name and the language they would like to be greeted in.</description>
